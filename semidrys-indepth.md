# In-depth review of semi-dry wetsuits

> The gist: Semi-drys are a compromise between the low cost and simplicity of wetsuits and diving in much pricier and more complex drysuits. In the end I found that price and quality are not well correlated in the few offerings in this line, with the best choice being one I discovered only by accident. Most people won't endure what I did in the quest for the perfect semi-dry, making this hopefully helpful for others considering semi-dry diving suits.

I get uncomfortably cold in water below 70F (21C) in even the thickest wetsuit. Thus, I’ve spent more time in the pursuit of the perfect semi-dry suit than most people would (or should). A semi-dry suit is a compromise solution. The calculus isn’t simple, which is why I’ve decided to write it all down. Doing so helped me immensely. Whether it will do the same for others is an open question. 

Being a guy this review is slanted towards men's suits. However, the brands I've reviewed make suits specific to each gender. I presume that the same considerations apply to women, but am keen to learn of any thoughts and experiences to the contrary.

##  The case for (semi-)dry

Before looking at specific products I considered my use cases. Living in the American Southwest, I have to get on an airplane for much of my diving, almost always in the tropics. However, the two best local diving spots have water temperatures that range from 13-17C (55-62F). A drysuit would be ideal, but a semi-dry suit would seem to confer most of the benefits at a fraction of the cost. So, why isn’t this an easy decision?

* Neither suit type _prevents_ heat loss. They simply slow it down to safe rates. Ideally, the decision would turn on their relative rates of heat retention over time. That is, how long can I dive in each of them before hypothermia starts to affect me? Published comparisons inexplicably don’t exist. Everyone seems to *think* that drysuits will keep a diver warmer, but how much so or for how long seems unknown. 
* A single cylinder will last me between 30-70 minutes, depending on depth, exertion, stress, etc. My exposure suit must keep me warm for that long in 13-17C water. 
* Using [sidemount](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vhoa9weNnos) cylinders to reach wrecks at 60m (200 foot) depths will keep me underwater longer and colder at depth, such as the [wrecks in Chuuk Lagoon](https://scubadiverlife.com/top-five-technical-dives-chuuk-lagoon/). The differential heat retention of the two suit types becomes an important consideration at that point. 
* I like simple, with fewer moving parts (i.e., potential points of failure). If a semi-dry suit will suffice it is my preferred solution.

I must rely on intuition and advice from experienced divers given the lack of published evidence about how the two suit types stack up over the range of my contemplated uses. The consensus among my dive buddies is that a great semi-dry should be adequate for the colder water temperatures I plan to be in.

##  Fit

The value proposition of a semi-dry suit is that it lets in substantially less water than a wetsuit while eliminating the complications of a drysuit. For that to work your semi-dry must fit great. If not, your semi-dry demotes to a wetsuit for all practical purposes. Some factors I found important include:

* It needs to fit snugly and slightly restrict your movements. If you can get in and out without a hassle the suit is probably too big for you. 
* Once on there should be no gaps in the underarm or crotch, or have sags on your back, chest, and on your upper arms and knees. If you can pinch the suit and pull it away from your body it is probably too loose.
* The length should likewise be right. If the suit is too long for you the seals will not keep water out, defeating thermal retention, and the joints won't line up to allow comfortable movement.
* I want the flexibility to wear a vest like the [Waterproof U30](https://waterproof.eu/diving/products/accessories/vests/u30-undervest/) or the neutrally-buoyant Fourth Element [Thermocline vest and shorts](https://fourthelement.com/thermocline/) beneath a semi-dry suit without tightness in my abdomen. 

__Your choice of semi-dry should turn entirely on fit__. Other considerations only matter if you find a perfect fit in more than one brand. If you cannot find a perfect fit then stick with a wetsuit with the Fourth Element Thermocline or Sharkskin Titanium vest and shorts beneath if additional warmth is needed.

The other important consideration with respect to fit is the donning and doffing process. It takes more work to get into a semi-dry than a wetsuit, as the seals must be tighter around your wrists, ankles, and neck. If you lose your patience you will likely stretch or damage the neoprene in ways that will reduce the lifespan and effectiveness of your semi-dry. I use a solution with diluted [Stream2Sea shampoo](https://www.amazon.com/Stream2Sea-FBA_COSH-6-Conditioning-Shampoo-BodyWash/dp/B01HR8V04C/) to lubricate my arms and calves while donning my semi-dry to help ease the process. I don't like it but dislike the alternatives far more.

##  Semi-dry options

The top contenders appeared to be the Hollis Neotek, ScubaPro Nova Scotia, and Waterproof SD4 and SD Combat suits. All looked great on paper, so the choice boiled down to finding the perfect fit and features. In the end an entry from O'Three beat them out, and a new offering from Apeks looks cautiously promising. 

### Hollis Neotek

If ease of finding them in local dive shops and [positive online reviews](https://www.scubaboard.com/community/threads/my-indepth-review-of-the-hollis-neotek-semi-dry.448480/) are any guide the [Hollis Neotek](https://www.hollis.com/neotek-semi-drysuit/) is the best semi-dry suit in existence. A long-time friend raves about it. Of all the people I’ve talked to few had negative feedback. 

At $549 for the recently updated V2 version it's the second-lowest priced of the contenders. It’s also the most basic, which isn’t necessarily a bad thing. It comes with a hood attached, and it is through it that water is stopped from entering the suit from the top. It’s possible to dive with the hood pulled back, but at the cost of a lot of bulk around your neck and water freely flowing in. Thus, you must be fine with always diving with the hood on. 

In the best fit for me (medium large) I call this my "neodry" suit. Water seeps in up to my elbows and to below my knees, but the dams on the inside of the suit there keep me almost completely dry elsewhere else. If I look down sharply to look between my knees or turn my head to look back over either shoulder cold water seeps in around the hood, but otherwise this is almost a drysuit in function. 

A big advantage of the Neotek is the front zipper across the shoulders. I never dive alone, which vendors and fans of back-zippered suits claim negates any advantage of a front zip. Maybe so, but I do go to the bathroom alone, and having the ability to unzip the suit solo in those circumstances is a big plus. Some reviewers complain about it not having a YKK zipper, but in my use so far it doesn't leak. It also has extra padding along the length of the spine. I dive a wing-style BCD with backplane, so this doesn’t help me. But I can see how divers in a jacket-style BCD might appreciate that feature. 

The Neotek fits like a glove. It has two thigh pockets with D-rings inside. Some people complained about them being too hard to open while suited, but I had no problem getting a frameless mask in and out underwater. However, the pockets are small, better suited for slates than reels. On the plus side they don't push out against the cylinder base when diving sidemounts.

You won't encounter the Neotek's downside until you doff it. It fits so well that it's almost impossible for me to pull the hood over my head, as the sleeves strongly resist lifting the top part of the suit. I need a friend to pull the top of the suit off me, and even then it can be a bit of work. Despite its other qualities it is hands down the hardest semi-dry to get out of that I've tried to date. 

Hollis was incredibly helpful when I reached out them to find a dealer. They suggested going to a shop that uses them for their dive classes, which would not only allow me to try all sizes but see how they look after many uses. They connected me with [International Scuba](https://internationalscuba.com/) in Carrollton, Texas, who were as great as I was told they were. 

Bottom line: The Neotek performs so well and the value proposition is so high that it's almost impossible to beat if it fits you well and you're okay with always diving hooded. But getting out of it requiring a strong buddy pulling your head free.  

### ScubaPro Nova Scotia

The [ScubaPro Nova Scotia](https://ww2.scubapro.com/en-GB/SWE/divewear/wetsuits/products/novascotia-75.aspx) is a back-zippered 7.5mm semi-dry suit without an attached hood. It has zippered ankles and wrists with underlying cuffs, allowing a better seal around gloves and boots than possible with the Neotek. It only has one zippered thigh pocket that sticks out too far for sidemount divers and is too small to hold what most technical divers with backmount cylinders want to carry. In the end you need to cut the pocket off and use tech diving shorts for the latter. I was otherwise impressed with the workmanship, and the suit exudes quality. Like the Neotek, it has extra padding on the spine. And I really liked the metal YKK zipper. The double seals at the wrist, neck, and ankles allow you to tuck gloves, hood, and boots between the inner rubber seal and the neoprene shell, better blocking water from entering the suit. 

Bottom line: I don't favor the back zipper across the shoulders. Between that and the single large thigh pocket the Nova Scotia dropped off my list.

### Waterproof SD4 and SD Combat

Waterproof has an awesome reputation among my European friends, but they have almost no presence in North America. Finding their drysuits or knowledgable dealers is hard enough, but niche products like semi-drys are almost impossible to find without spending more on air travel to try on than the suits themselves.

Waterproof makes two semi-drys. Their [SD4](https://waterproof.eu/diving/products/semidry/sd4/) appears almost identical to the ScubaPro NovaScotia, with the biggest differences being blue shoulders and the lack of thigh pockets. In place of the latter the SD4 has a WPAD (Waterproof Personal Accessory Dock) anchor on the right thigh. The WPAD is a detachable [expandable pocket](https://waterproof.eu/diving/products/accessories/wp-accessories/wpad/) with zippered top closure and internal D-ring. I could not find a SD4 in medium to try on anywhere in North America. While the detachable WPAD pocket seemed like a great idea at first I'm worried that it's semi-permanent attachment might allow it to disappear right when I need it the most. I might be more interested if there were multiple WPAD options. On the other hand the ability to remove the pocket without scissors is a big plus for sidemount divers.

I was ready to give up on Waterproof, but then started looking closer at their 7mm [SD Combat](https://waterproof.eu/diving/products/semidry/sd-combat/) ($950). It's double the price of the Neotek and also has cross-back zipper entry, two drawbacks for me. It's all-black color isn't as nice as the SD4's blue accent, and having "Combat" prominently stamped on my right arm wasn't exactly a drawing feature, either. In fact, the only reason I was still paying attention was that I hadn’t found the perfect semi-dry yet and its separate hood. Almost by accident I found a dealer four hours away that improbably had a size medium in their shop. It was somewhat out of the way on a road trip I'd soon be making, so I decided to make the effort to see it in person. I regret doing so, for you can't see it without wanting it badly. The medium was a bit too tight, but it felt great crouching, twisting, and doing a pull-up in it. The suit is molded for [optimal diving position](https://blog.divessi.com/optimal-trim-for-diving-3008.html), whereas I feel like I'm straining against the hood's desire to hold me face down in the Neotek. 

The SD Combat is cut for an athletic build. I’m fortunately close enough to that for it to work for me, but my European friends warned that this suit might be the worst-fitting for the standard American physique. I totally agree. I bought a medium-large assuming that it would be an exact great fit. Alas, I don't emerge from dives as dry on the inside as I do in my Neotek. While the Neotek seems to let in a constant small amount of water at all depths the SD Combat seems to leak more below 30 meters. It also leaks more through the zipper than the Neotek. However, the influx is slow enough that it heats up quickly. I’d be lying if I said the rear zipper has won me over yet, but the rest of this suit has. I find the detachable hood to be a more versatile configuration than the Neotek's attached design, and more comfortable underwater. The [H1 5/7mm hood](https://waterproof.eu/diving/products/accessories/hoods/h1-5-7-hood/) that comes with the suit has a large enough skirt to cover the collar on the suit but adds little bulk around the neck. It's as close to perfect a hood as I've come across yet.

Waterproof products are __far__ more difficult to find in North America than Hollis and ScubaPro. When I contacted their North American distributor about most likely dealers to have the SD Combat I received a curt reply that they have no idea what stock levels their dealers have. I spent an afternoon calling dive shops all over North America in forlorn attempt to find just one with both a medium and medium large in stock.  

Bottom line: The SD Combat easily beat out those I tried before it, and I was having a hard time imagining how anything could dethrone it. There is so much lost potential with this suit, for with an effective North American presence Waterproof would both give the Hollis Neotek a serious run for their money and put a big dent in drysuit sales for everyone.

### The O'Three 65 Semi-Dry

When I searched online for semi-dry ideas and reviews I never once saw mention of the offering from O'Three in the U.K. I was diving with some technical divers from out of state when I noticed one of them was wearing what appeared to be an O'Three wetsuit. When I asked him about it he replied that it was actually their back-zip [65 Semi-Dry](https://www.othree.co.uk/shop/65-diving-semi-dry-wetsuit/) suit. To make a long story short, I wound up diving later that day in his suit to try it out. He wore a medium-large, which was too long for me. But despite the misfit it thoroughly impressed me. The quality was amazing and because of its adjustable neck strap I still kept water leakage to a minimum. The suit does not have thigh pockets, but my Apeks tech diving shorts fit over it just fine. That gives me the ability to use it for both backmount and sidemount diving. The separate hood fits me well. The water temperature that afternoon was about 58F, but I was still warm when I surfaced almost an hour later. 

As impressed as I was, the most amazing things about the 65 suit were yet to come. The suit costs about $370, and in subsequent conversations with O'Three have found them to be one of the most responsive companies out there. The suit is 6mm thick, so on the thin side compared to the others here, but I've really come around to the versatility of wearing Fourth Element Thermocline vest and shorts to give me additional warmth when needed, but more comfortable in summer than the other semi-drys considered.

Bottom line: This is hands down my favorite semi-dry suit. It's not quite as effective as the Neotek at keeping water out but it is *far* easier to don and doff. 

### Apeks ThermiQ

The [Apeks ThermiQ](https://www.apeksdiving.com/products/dive-wear/product/thermiq-8-7-wetsuit.html) is a new product in 2021. It looks similar to the Hollis NeoTek V2 but costs more—if you can find it anywhere in stock. Like the Neotek, it is 8mm thick in the abdomen and 7mm thick elsewhere. From online reviews it appears to be a great product, but the Apeks dealers I usually buy through here in North America bemoan that they don’t expect to receive them until next year at the rate Apeks is filling orders. I will update this page with my impressions when I get one.  

Bottom line: The ThermiQ will have a tough time beating out the cheaper and excellent Neotek V2 suit that it so closely resembles in design and features. I’m a huge Apeks fan but their supply chain is a dumpster fire. That’s a lot to overcome to beat out excellent semi-drys you can get now. But if it is easier to doff than the Neotek this could quickly become my favorite suit.

## One big drawback to semidrys

If you stay well-hydrated it's almost impossible to dive for an hour without the unrelenting urge to pee. It's even worse on longer dives with sidemounts. In a wetsuit you just pull open your collar after succumbing to the urge to cycle the water in your suit. But if you're wearing a semi-dry and you have almost no water already inside it's like peeing in your pants. I only see three alternatives: diapers, reduce fluid intake prior to diving, or holding it no matter how uncomfortable you get. 

Diving dehydrated is dangerous, reducing your physical and mental endurance and capabilities, and it [increases your chances of decompression sickness](https://www.daneurope.org/hydration-safety-campaign) even if you stay within your table or computer limits. Some friends have worked on staying well hydrated for 72 hours prior to the dive but tapering off two hours before diving to reduce the need to pee while submerged. This seems to work for some but is offset by [immersion diuresis](https://www.dansa.org/blog/2019/07/15/nine-factors-that-play-a-major-role-in-a-scuba-diver-s-dehydration). No one I dive with seems capable of holding it for an entire hour underwater regardless of the tricks employed. 

I've asked both O'Three and Waterproof whether they could add a drysuit pee valve to their semi-drys. I'd probably not use them on every dive, but for long sidemount dives or those with long deco hang times the alternatives are grim. Both convinced me that the fabric in their semi-drys are too thin and fragile to mount a pee valve. Thus, semi-drys are probably not appropriate for technical diving with long hang times. You must be able to live with that consequence in order to thrive in semi-drys.

I have a pee valve on my crushed neoprene [Ri 2-100 suit from O’Three](https://www.othree.co.uk/drysuit-range/ri-2-100-drysuit/). It shows no signs of tearing away from the suit. I’m not sure why it wouldn’t be as durable on a thicker semi-dry suit but trust they know what they’re talking about. But maybe a drysuit pee valve is overkill, for some reverse leakage isn’t the issue it would be in a drysuit. Maybe a simpler and flatter design might work? 

Until someone perfects the semi-dry pee valve there is no practical, much less smart, alternative to peeing in your suit. It's gross but necessary. If you cannot rinse out your suit between dives or pour a lot of warm water through during your surface interval you'll smell exceptionally ripe afterwards. If you cannot deal with this reality then semi-drys are probably not for you.

If you’ve made it this far please relentlessly badger the companies above to invent a pee value for semi-drys. Seriously. We’re living in the 21st century, after all.
